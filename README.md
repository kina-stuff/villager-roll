# villager-roll
After a long day it is time for the villagers to head back home. Drag your mouse on the people to lead each villager to the light, and make sure all villagers reach the light!

Text in credits, results, etc. might be blurry for Windows users, not sure why that is and I wasn't able to fix it, sorry :sob:

Controls:
Click and drag with left mouse button on a villager to move them!
